Licensing the SDK</h1>
<p>After purchasing the OPC UA .NET SDK you will receive your personal license file and a Release version of the SDK. To activate the license in your application, you need to take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>add the license file to your project as an embedded resource;</li>
<li>use the current Release version of the <a class="el" href="namespaceUnifiedAutomation.html">UnifiedAutomation</a> assemblies;</li>
<li>load your license file during start-up in the <code>Main()</code> function of the application (see example below).</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>You should always use the license file that comes with your SDK version!</dd></dl>
<p>In the following example, the name of the resource, <code>UnifiedAutomation.Sample.License.License.lic</code>, is composed of</p><ul>
<li>the namespace <code>UnifiedAutomation.Sample</code>; remember to change this to the namespace used in your product;</li>
<li>the path to the license file <code>License.License.lic</code>; the license file (<code>License.lic</code>) is in our example located in an extra folder called <em>License</em>; remember to change this to your own folder structure.</li>
